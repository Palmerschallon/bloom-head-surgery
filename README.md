# bloom-head-surgery
 Surgical reinitialization recovers 98.7% of collapsed attention heads in BLOOM transformers. Includes cross-scale diagnosis (560M-7.1B),  two-phenomenon framework (functional redistribution vs local degradation),  and evidence that healthy heads also improve. Pretrained attention is a local minimum, not a global one.
